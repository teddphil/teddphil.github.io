<h1>Profile</h1>

<h3>
Quantitative Researcher/Developer
</h3>

<p>
Derivatives Pricing & Risk Analytics | C++/Python Expert | PhD Machine Learning
</p>

<p>
Quantitative Researcher / Developer specialising in production-grade pricing engines, risk management 
systems, and model validation frameworks for multi-asset derivatives. Expert in C++ and 
Python for building Monte Carlo simulators, volatility surface calibrators, and regulatory 
capital calculators. Strong foundation in stochastic calculus, statistical modelling, and 
financial engineering with direct applications to interest rate products, credit risk, and 
counterparty exposure management.
</p>

8+ years building high-performance quantitative systems for large-scale time-series and 
high-dimensional data. Experienced in translating complex models into robust, well-tested, 
governance-ready code that supports risk reporting, model validation, and regulatory 
compliance (Basel III, FRTB, SA-CCR). Proven ability to explain technical concepts to 
non-technical stakeholders and work across quantitative research, technology, and business teams.
